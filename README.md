# BrainApp

BrainApp is a tool for segmentation of MRI images, originally intended for brain tumor segmentation, it can be used for general purpose segmentation in MRI. It uses simple segmentation algorithms from ITK.

The user interface is implemented with PyQt and VTK.

Disclaimer: this is an old project I keep here for archive purposes. 
(The code could be adapted to work with updated  PyQt and VTK/ITK)
